        <h1>The Activist's Center for Justice</h1>
	<p>Your source for information and resources on civil rights, the environment, and any other worldly concerns. It is
		so common to see activism for these movements come and go with "the trend". We cannot let this happen. Use 
		this as a resource to stay active and educated.</p>

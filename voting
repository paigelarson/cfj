        <h1>Voting</h1>
	<p>One of the great things about democracy is that the people have a voice. We, at least in theory, should all be able to have a say in how our government is run.
  The easiest way to do so is by voting! By electing local, regional, and national politicians who represent us, we can take part in making sure the right
  people are put in power. By voting for bills and actions, we can turn movements into structured legal requirements that will uphold equality and justice in our
  government.</p>

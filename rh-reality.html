        <h1>The Reality of Reproductive Health</h1>
    
    <p> Reproductive Health applies to everyone. The World Health Organization defines it as "Reproductive health is a state of complete physical,
	    mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and
	    to its functions and processes." This means that just because you do not have a menstrual cycle or are not at risk for pregnancy or breast
		cancer does not mean that you do not have to pay attention to Reproductive Health. However, the areas of reproductive health involving 
		abortion and the menstrual cycle are in the most danger. If we stand by as our politicians put anti-choice legislature into our lawbooks,
		we only put more women's lives at risk, since they are now forced to seek more unsafe matters of terminating the pregnancy. In the case of
		menstrual hygiene, those affected end up spending around $18,000 on period products throughout their lifetime. These items are taxed as a
		luxury, even though they are a necessary part of said person's life. Regardless, reproductive Health is an important part of everyone's life
		whether they realize it or not. This occurs in the form of sexually transmitted diseases, reproductive system cancers, family planning, contraceptive
		methods, and many other situations. We must remain active in protecting and preserving our reproductive rights.</p>

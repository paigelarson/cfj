        <h1>Why is Protesting Important?</h1>
	<p>The first ammendment gives the citizens of the United States the freedom of speech. This means that we are allowed to stand
  up for what we believe in. This is what protesting is at it's core. This is the people banding together to make a change, be it
  at a local, regional, or national level. Our right to protest is important because it gives us a voice. It provides minority
  groups with a way to voice their needs, which often go overlooked in the standard workings of our government. It also starts the
  conversation and raises awareness for causes that we believe are important. Most importantly, Protest has the power to
  lead to change. We speak up and voice our concerns, which may lead to politicians getting on board with the cause and sponsering
  legislation in favor of the cause. As the people who live in this country, our right to protest is an important part of civilians
  taking part in government and having their needs addressed, which is one of the most important resposibilites of our government."</p>

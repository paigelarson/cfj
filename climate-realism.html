        <h1>What is Climate Change and Why is it a Problem?</h1>
    <p>Climate Change is the exponentially increasing temperatures that scientists have observed on our planet. This is a result of human activity 
      increasing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, which means a greater "greenhouse effect" between the solar energy coming from the sun
      and atmospheric gasses such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. The World Meteorological Organization found that the 20 warmest years
      on record all occured in the last 22 years. This shows a dangerous trend for the future of earth's climate. However, there is much more at stake
      than not being able to wear your favorite winter coat. Climate Change has been found responsible for the melting of the polar ice caps along with
      other glaciers, which has resulted in rising sea levels. It could also cause fresh water shortages, which would then alter our ability to produce food.
    Climate Change has been observed to be responsible for an increase in extreme weather events such as floods, heatwaves, droughts, and storms. This isn't
    even mentioning the millions of animal and plant species who will be displaced or run into extinction by loss of habitat or sources of food and water. Overall, 
    Climate Change is very real and very much a problem. This is our home. Earth is the only place we know. It would be heartless and irresponsible to allow humanity
    to destroy it. Since we are the ones ruining our planet, it is our job to fix this. To return the earth to her natural beauty, or risk perishing in uninhabitable
    conditions. Climate Change is one of the most pressing problems our society faces today.</p>

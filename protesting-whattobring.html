        <h1>What to Bring to a Protest</h1>
	<p>If it is your first protest, you may be wondering what you should bring vs. leave at home. This is a list of basic items
  that may come in handy at any protest you plan on attending, as well as good plans of action.</p>
	<br>	
   <h3>Things to Bring</h3> 
     <ul>
      <li>Bring as little as possible, since you'll have to hold everything. Small backpacks are great for carrying essentials.</li>
      <li>Bring a sign to show your support for the movement</li>
      <li>Dress in layers. This gives you the flexibility to take off or put on layers depending on the weather. Hats and 
      sunscreen are also a good idea when it's sunny.</li>
      <li>If it is raining, clear umbrellas allow you to stay dry while still being able to see speakers and not block 
      anyone else's view.</li>
      <li>Bring some form of ID just in case you face arrest.</li>
      <li>Light snacks and water are paramount for keeping yourself nourished and hydrated.</li>
      <li>Bring a phone charger. If your phone dies, you'll be unable to communicate with friends if you get lost or arrested.</li>
      <li>If you have long hair, bring a hair tie for if it gets hot and you want to put your hair up.</li>
      <li>Wear sensible shoes, since you will be most likely be walking or spending a lot of time on your feet.</li>
 
     </ul>
     
     <br>
     
     <h3>Things to Know</h3> 
     <ul>
      <li>Know where and when the protest is taking place. If a march is taking place, understand the march route.</li>
      <li>Know about the cause! If you are protesting, chances are you already support the activism, but make sure to 
      stay educated and updated on the current state of the movement, as well as the history that brought it to the protest you
      are attending.</li>
      <li>Know your own limits. </li>
      <li>Know that you are here for the cause. This is not a photo shoot or just an opportunity to see your friends. If you are
      posting on social media, make sure it is advocating for the cause and spreading awareness!</li>
 
     </ul>

        		<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
				<p> This website exists as a space to allow people to educate themselves on the issues our societies face on a daily
          basis. Some are more affected by each issue than others, but that does not mean that we cannot all stand up and 
          fight for what we know is right. </p>
          
        <p> As the website's developer, I, Paige Larson, aspire to use my skills to better both individual people's lives, and
          society as a whole. I believe the first step to doing so is by sharing information and raising awareness, which is the
          goal of creating this website. To everyone who is taking time out of their day to peruse this site, I genuinely thank you.
